# RuleBasedClassification

# I have developed a project that calculates lead-based classification using the Persona.csv dataset. This data set contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. My purpose in this project is to create new level-based customer definitions (personas) by using some features of a game company's customers, and to create segments according to these new customer definitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.
